READ ME!

HELLO! This is my first ever project and I had a lot of fun making it.

Before entering let me explain the interface.

GET = Calling up all of the available records
POST = Creating a new record through inputing new information
PUT = Editing information in a record through selection via ID number
The second GET = Calling up a specific record via ID number
DELETE = Disposing of a record through use of ID number

Thank you for your time!
